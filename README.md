# configure-0.1.0
This file was automatically generated by ./configure

* Do you ever get the feeling that autotools/autoconf/M4 is too complicated for your project? 
* Have you ever wanted a script that will quickly set up a build directory and Makefiles for you?
* Do you want a configuration script that is actually human readable, simple, and configurable?

If so, then this is the tool for you.

Running `./configure` in an empty directory will generate the following directory tree and files:
```
./.config/
./build/
./src/
./include/
           --\ configure.h
./LICENSE (default MIT)
./Makefile
./README.md
./.gitignore
```

Configure.h contains defines based on any conditional tests you add to your configure script

Rerunning `./configure` with options later will simply regenerate your configure.h and Makefile

### Using configure
```
mkdir my-project
./configure
make
make install
```

Command line arguments:
```
--help:                 display help menu
--prefix=/path/to/dir   set the installation directory prefix
--cc=/path/to/compiler  set the C compiler
--cflags="-Wall -O3"    set the C compiler flags
--clean                 clean up the config and build directories, regenerate Makefile
```

### Configuring configure

Configure has builtin bash functions that allow for quick tests of C functions or header files.
For example:

```
check_function "stdio.h" printf '"%d"', 1
```

Will check that stdio.h contains a function called printf that takes the following arguments. A `#define CONFIGURE_PRINTF 1` line will be added to configure.h
